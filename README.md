# Kafka Connect UI

Angular application with Bootstrap CSS that provides a user interface for the Kafka Connect API.

## Project Overview

This project was entirely generated by Cline, an AI assistant for software development. Cline created all the code, components, services, and configurations needed to build a fully functional Kafka Connect UI.

## Features

- **Landing Page**: Users can enter the Kafka Connect API URL, which is stored in browser storage
- **Connectors List Page**: Displays all connectors from the API with a card-based UI
- **Connector Details Page**: Shows connector status, configuration, and provides options to update and delete connectors

## Technical Components Used by Cline

Cline utilized the following technologies and approaches to build this application:

1. **Angular Framework (v15)**: Created a complete Angular application structure with components, services, and routing
2. **TypeScript**: Implemented strongly-typed interfaces and services for better code quality
3. **Bootstrap CSS**: Integrated for responsive and modern UI design
4. **RxJS**: Used for reactive programming with Observables for API calls and state management
5. **Angular Routing**: Implemented navigation between different views
6. **Angular Guards**: Created route guards to protect routes that require API URL to be set
7. **Local Storage**: Implemented browser storage for persisting the API URL
8. **HTTP Client**: Used Angular's HttpClient for API communication
9. **Proxy Configuration**: Set up a proxy to handle CORS issues when communicating with the Kafka Connect API
10. **Component Architecture**: Organized code into reusable components with clear responsibilities
11. **Reactive Forms**: Implemented form handling with validation
12. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for API calls

## Project Structure

- **Components**: Landing, Connectors List, and Connector Details
- **Services**: Storage Service and Kafka Connect API Service
- **Models**: Connector, ConnectorConfig, Task, and ConnectorStatus interfaces
- **Guards**: API URL Guard to protect routes

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd kafka-connect-ui
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:4200

4. Enter your Kafka Connect API URL (e.g., http://localhost:8083)

## Development Process by Cline

Cline followed these steps to create the application:

1. Set up a new Angular project with routing and SCSS styling
2. Created the necessary components, services, and models
3. Implemented the storage service for persisting the API URL
4. Developed the Kafka Connect API service for communication with the API
5. Created the landing page with form validation
6. Implemented the connectors list page with card-based UI
7. Developed the connector details page with tabs for info, config, and tasks
8. Added route guards to protect routes that require API URL
9. Set up a proxy configuration to handle CORS issues
10. Styled the application with Bootstrap CSS
11. Added error handling and loading indicators

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates Cline's ability to generate a complete, functional Angular application with modern best practices. The code is well-structured, follows Angular conventions, and includes proper error handling and user experience considerations.
